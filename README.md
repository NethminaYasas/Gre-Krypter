# Gre-Krypter (Vigenere)
This repository contains Python code for a simple encryption and decryption program. The program utilizes a combination of the Greek alphabet and English alphabet to encrypt and decrypt messages. It includes functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

## Tutorial
Program starts with asking, Whether the user wants to Encrypt a message or Decrypt an already encrypted message.

| Direction | Input |
| -------- | -------- |
| Encrypt   | 1   |
| Decrypt   | -1   |

 
After, You need to enter the message, which you need to Encrypt/Decrypt.

Then the program is going to ask you for an encryption key, And if you dont have a key, you can generate a new key by inputting **ZERO** / **0**.

If you want to change the Complexity or the length of the key, Which the computer is going to generate. You need to change the **range({value})** in the line **91**.
